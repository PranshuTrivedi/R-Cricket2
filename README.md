<h3>My R programming and Python projects</h3>
<p> This repository contains four projects done by me on RStudio and Python.</p>
<br><br>
<p><B>(1)Decision trees on Python:</B>Here I have created a fake data set which includes details of applicants for job and the decision
tree determines if the factors lead them to being hired or not.</p>
<br><br>
<p> <b> (2)Suicide rate analysis on RStudio:</b>This includes visualisation and analyis of a data in the US about the rates of suicied based 
on several factors.</p>
<br><br>
<p> <b> (3)XGboost using Python:</b>This project demonstrates the use of Extreme Gradient boosting on Python which is a powerful algorithm
in machine learning used to classify and predict the data. I have used the iris dataset and tried to predict the species of flower at the end of it.</P>
<br><br>
<p> <b> (4) Carprice analysis on RStudio:</b>This deals with the analysis of a car dataset to check what kind of car would be better suited
